## ðŸ”— Submodules

Some projects are included as Git submodules. For example:

- `ECE411_CompOrg/mp_OoO` â€“ an Out-of-Order RISC-V Processor

To clone this repository along with all submodules:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:sy2u/course-archive.git
```
Or, if you've already cloned it:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
